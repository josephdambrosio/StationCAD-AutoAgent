# StationCAD-AutoAgent


StationCAD AutoAgent is a chrome browser extension based off Ir8Coder's IAR-Injection project.  

StationCAD AutoAgent is designed as a solution for the StationCAD Watchdesk web app to automatically log in users based on preset credentials. 

This is ideal for vehicle MDTs and other installed displays where keeping a system logged in after power failure or device reboot is needed.
 



## To Install...

Download the most recent .zip package from the deployments tab to right.

Extract the ZIP archive to a folder of your choosing.

Open Chrome, and go to: "chrome://extensions/"

Select "load unpacked" from the top left, and naviage to the newly unzipped folder.

You will be prompted for your StationCAD watchdesk login credentials.

Select Save & Close.

Watch the magic happen.

Enjoy!
